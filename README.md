This is a NYTimes Article Search App that utilizes Mongo, Mongoose, Express React, and Node
In this current iteration the database is not set up but the user may query data and have it populate on
the client side.  The Mongo database is for the functionality of saving articles.  That remains on my To-Do List
Pseudocode notes exist in the Article.js file inside of the models folder as well as in the server.js file.

Here is the Heroku link for the app in its current state:
